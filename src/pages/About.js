				My name is Lai Jian Shin; you can call me Andy. I am a student studying
				at the Chinese University of Hong Kong - and I practice photography as a
				side hobby and have been very passionate with the art since 2013.{" "}
				<br></br>
				<br></br>I had my first camera in 2015, the Sony A6000, and have
				shooting with it together with the kit lens (the 16-50mm and 55-210mm)
				that came with it ever since. It's not the most impressive set of gears
				but it gets the work done!{" "}

				Thank you for taking the time in visiting and viewing my work and
				galleries!
