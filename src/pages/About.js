				Hello!
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				Firstly, thank you for visiting my photography website. My name is Lai
				Jian Shin; you can call me Andy! I am a Computer Science student at the
				Chinese University of Hong Kong. I have built this website not only to
				display my portfolio and my work in photography but also to exercise my
				web development. I hoped to create and design a web page design that can
				reflect my own work in photography as well - a look and feel of
				serenity, elegance and youthfulness.
				<br></br>
				<br></br>I have been practicing photography as a side hobby since 2013.
				After a trip to Turkey, my mom and I realized that it’d be better if we
				had our hands with an actual camera - not a 5 megapixel smartphone
				(although that’s really where I started off in my photography
				adventure). That camera we later got was the Sony A6000, and it has been
				amazingly faithful to me ever since. I have and am still shooting with
				it together with the kit lens that came with it - the 16-50mm and
				55-210mm kit lenses. Not the best glass out there, but it gets the work
				done well enough!
				<br></br>
				<br></br>I hope my work and my galleries are inspiring and enjoyable.
				Thank you, truly, for having taken the time to read through all these
				and to view my work and my galleries. If you want to check out the code
				base, feel free to check out my github!
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				Best,
				<br></br>- Andy
