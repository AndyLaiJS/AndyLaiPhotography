				Hello!
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				Firstly, thank you for visiting my photography website. My name is Lai
				Jian Shin; you can call me Andy! I am a Computer Science student at the
				Chinese University of Hong Kong. I built this website obviously to
				showcase my work and establish it as my portfolio for my photography,
				but I also used this project of building this website from scratch as a
				means to exercise my web development (cause you know, my future kind of
				depends on it). In designing this website, I hoped that its design is a
				reflection of my work in photography as well - a look and feel of
				serenity, elegance and youthfulness.
				<br></br>
				<br></br>I have been practicing photography as a hobby since 2013. After
				a trip to Turkey, my mom and I realized that it’d be better if we had
				our hands with an actual camera - not a 5 megapixel smartphone (although
				that’s really where I started off in my journey into photography). That
				camera we later got was the Sony A6000, and it has been amazingly
				faithful to me ever since. I have and am still shooting with it together
				with the kit lens that came with it - the 16-50mm and 55-210mm kit
				lenses. Not the best glass out there, but it gets the work done.
				<br></br>
				<br></br>I hope my work and my galleries are inspiring and enjoyable.
				Thank you, really, for having taken the time to read through all these
				and to view my work and my galleries. Feel free to follow me at my
				instagram and contact me about anything at all! Happy to connect! For
				the software people that stumbled here somehow, I have my code base in
				my github that you are more than free to check em' out!
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				Best,
				<br></br>- Andy
